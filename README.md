# Barbershop Scheduling API

Hair Day is a simple and modern appointment scheduling application built with vanilla JavaScript.

The project allows users to:

- Select available hours
- Schedule appointments
- Load appointments by selected day
- Cancel appointments
- Persist data using a local API (JSON Server)

This project was created to practice modular architecture, API communication, DOM manipulation, and clean frontend structure without frameworks.

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic hour loading based on selected date
- Appointment creation (name + date + time)
- Daily schedule filtering
- Appointment cancellation
- Real-time UI updates
- Local API persistence (JSON Server)

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project focuses on:
	•	Modular JavaScript architecture
	•	Separation of concerns
	•	Async workflows and API integration
	•	DOM event delegation
	•	Error handling and state synchronization
	•	Frontend ↔ backend communication without frameworks

  ---

  ## 🛠 Development Notes

During development, several structural and visual issues were resolved, including:
	•	API integration flow
	•	Schedule rendering logic
	•	Correct DELETE handling
	•	Consistent ID management
	•	Frontend and backend synchronization
	•	UI stability and DOM updates

## 📁 Important Files

	•	server.json → local database used by JSON Server
	•	api-config.js → API base URL configuration
	•	services/ → API operations (fetch, create, delete)
	•	modules/schedules/ → schedule rendering and interactions
